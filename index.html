        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring Front End Web Developer who knew completely nothing about code. My first experience ever with code was astonishing and that was on Treehouse. I always had the dream of getting a job which has some connections with the use of computers, fortunately for me i found myself fitting into the Front End field. Am so grateful to Treehouse for gradually making making my dreams come to reality.</p>
        <p>I am a focus person, and i am willing to give in my all and more extra hours to fulfil my dream of becoming a Front End Web Developer.</p>
